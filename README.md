# homey

Homey is a self-hosted service dashboard inspired by Homer. It became clear that it would be a better idea to write something from scratch instead of heavily modify a Homer fork, becuase I wanted to:
* Extend API functionality
* Extend layout customization options
* Remove all functionality I was not using
* Add juicy CSS animations, WebGL toys, easter eggs, etc

It also seemed like a good project to learn Vue.js - modular complexity with a few basic functions at the core.

## Project setup
```
yarn install
yarn serve
```
