**Work in progress! Not ready yet.**

Homey is a simple home server dashboard loosely inspired by Homer. Manage running docker containers via portainer, access all your services, view weather forecasts, and play with a 3D spinning house - all from one cozy page!  Built with:

* SASS (layout; frontend)
* Vue (reactive single page design)
* Three.js & Tween.js (eyecandy)

*For API functionality (portainer, weather, etc) [homey-server](https://github.com/vlfldr/homey-server) is required.*

## Project setup
```
npm i
npm run dev
```
Dockerization & corresponding documentation is yet to come.
